## üöÄ Project Overview

In today's world, fake news spreads rapidly across digital platforms, creating misinformation and confusion. Our *Fake News Detection and Fact-Checking System* automatically verifies the authenticity of news articles and provides factual corrections using a fact-checking API.

### Key Features
- **Fake News Detection:** Classifies news articles as true or fake using machine learning models trained on labeled datasets.
- **Fact Checking:** Takes the entered news and returns factually verified information.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** A web-based system with a simple, intuitive design for users to input news articles.
- **Modular Design:** Clear separation between news detection and fact-checking components, enabling easy updates.

## üéØ Objectives <a name="objectives"></a>

1. Identify and detect fake news articles.
2. Provide accurate fact-checks for the input text.
3. Ensure a reliable and user-friendly interface to enhance user experience.
4. Improve accuracy through model optimization.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack <a name="tech-stack"></a>

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Machine Learning:** Scikit-learn, TensorFlow
- **Web Framework:** Django
- **Database:** SQLite for storage of user-submitted news articles
- **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap
- **APIs:** External Fact-Checking API

---

## üßπ Data Preprocessing <a name="data-preprocessing"></a>

- Datasets: `true.csv`, `false.csv` from Kaggle.
- Preprocessing steps include:
  - Cleaning and normalizing the text.
  - Tokenization and vectorization (TF-IDF).
  - Handling missing or noisy data.

---

## üß† Model Training <a name="model-training"></a>

- **Classifier Used:** Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or other classifiers.
- **Metrics:** Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score.
- **Training Process:**
  - Train the model on a dataset containing true and false news articles.
  - Test and evaluate model performance using cross-validation.

---

## üîé Fact-Checking <a name="fact-checking"></a>

The fact-checking feature uses an external API to:
- Extract key information from the news article.
- Return verified factual content to counter the input news.
- Display corrected information in the web app.

---

## ‚öîÔ∏è Challenges <a name="challenges"></a>

1. **Data Imbalance:** Balancing true and false news in the dataset.
2. **Fact-Checking API:** Finding an efficient, accurate API for real-time fact-checking.
3. **Accuracy:** Continuously improving the model's performance and reliability.

---

## üöÄ Future Scope <a name="future-scope"></a>

- **Expand the Dataset:** Continuously improve detection accuracy with larger datasets.
- **API Integration:** Enhance the fact-checking feature with more reliable and broader APIs.
- **Multi-language Support:** Add support for fake news detection in various languages.
